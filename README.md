# MN Parkinson's Connect

A free activity finder for people with Parkinson's disease and their caregivers in Minnesota. Search and filter local programs by type, intensity, cost, format, and distance.

Activity data is managed through Airtable and the site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## Configuration

The site talks to Airtable through Cloudflare Pages Functions (in `functions/api/`). All credentials and identifiers are stored as **server-side environment variables** in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard (Settings → Environment variables) and are never committed to this repo or bundled into the browser:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `AIRTABLE_PAT` | Airtable personal access token (the secret — keep private) |
| `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` | The Airtable base identifier |
| `AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID` | The activities table identifier |

To find the base and table IDs, open the table in Airtable and read them from the URL (`airtable.com/<baseId>/<tableId>/...`). See `.env.example` for the variable names to set. Never paste the PAT into client-side code or commit it.

## Geocoding

Latitude/Longitude are filled automatically by the Airtable Automation defined in [`airtable-automation/geocode.js`](airtable-automation/geocode.js). Setup instructions are in the comments at the top of that file. The old local Python script is no longer needed.
